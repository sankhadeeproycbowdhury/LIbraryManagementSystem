# ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ IIIT Sonepat

We have developed a **prototype software system** to streamline and automate complex library operations at the **Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Sonepat**. This solution enhances the day-to-day workflow of librarians and administrators by introducing a secure and intelligent platform built using **FastAPI** for the backend and **JavaScript** for the frontend.

To ensure security during book transactions, an **OTP-based validation system** is implemented when issuing booksâ€”minimizing fraud and enforcing accountability. Additionally, we have integrated **Chart.js** into the dashboard to generate dynamic, visual library usage reports. These charts assist librarians and administrators in tracking book issues, returns, and usage patterns effectively.
